# CPP-Ssnake
My first 'independent' project made after my first semester at university Lyon 1 (UCBL)
[4 months of uni coding classes in C++ & algorithms & math].

Built using the library "GrAPiC" (http://liris.cnrs.fr/alexandre.meyer/grapic/html/index.html).

I used Code::Blocks, but Express Studio should not have any problems.
Instruction to set up library on site.
