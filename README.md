# CPP-Ssnake
My first 'independent' project made after my first semester at university Lyon 1 (UCBL)
[4 months of uni coding classes in C++ & algorithms & math].

Built using the library "GrAPiC" (http://liris.cnrs.fr/alexandre.meyer/grapic/html/index.html).

I used Code::Blocks, but Visual Studio should not have any problems.
Instruction for setting up the library on site.

-> Merge the folders "apps" , "data" and "build" with your grapic library. Then open the CB project in the build folder for Ssnake.

Executable :

The executable file should work with most PCs, else you will have to compile yourself.
The executable will probably not be updated as frequently as the source files.
